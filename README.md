# Named Entity Recognition - (NER)
This repository focuses on employing advanced models and data processing techniques for Named Entity Recognition (NER). It features four models: an SVM model (Model 1), a Feed-Forward Network model (Model 2), an LSTM model (Model 3), and a competitive LSTM bidirectional model (Competitive Model). A unique aspect of our approach is the use of word embeddings, created by combining GloVe and Word2Vec models. To enhance the F1 score, we have addressed class imbalance in the competitive model through various techniques, such as under-sampling, over-sampling, and class-weight adjustments. Our report, included in this repository, offers a comprehensive overview of all methodologies and detailed implementations. The repository also contains the data folder and an instructions file for easy usage.
